### Build an MSK Suggestion Management Board

**Background**

A regional director of health, safety and wellbeing at a client has been tasked with reducing rates of MSK absence in the company. They've rolled out VIDA to help them achieve it. Now they need to ensure employees are reducing their risk based on suggestions made by VIDA. These suggestions come in four forms:

1. **Targeted exercises**¬†working on strength, flexibility and balance (guided by VIDA)
2. **Workspace adjustments or equipment orders**¬†(e.g., changing monitor height, external mouse for laptop)
3. **Behavioural changes**¬†(e.g., taking micro breaks throughout the day)
4. **Lifestyle changes**¬†(e.g. changing sleep, exercise or diet patterns)

**The Challenge**

We want you to build a Kanban-style board which allows the admin to process any suggestions made by VIDA which require admin actions and track and update the progress as they action them.

**Requirements**

**Frontend**

- Build an accessible, interactive Kanban board that lets the admin move tasks around and track their progress
- The board should clearly display the relevant information for each suggestion
- Consider the user experience for an admin who might be managing suggestions for dozens of employees
- Use a front end framework of your choosing

**Backend**

- Build an API to retrieve the suggestions and allow the admin to update the progress on them
- You may use C# or another language of your choice
- **For data storage**: Use in-memory storage (no need to use a database)

**What We're Looking For**

- Clean, maintainable code that follows best practices
- A polished user interface that would work in a professional setting
- Consideration for the domain and business context
- Your approach to structuring both frontend and backend code
- How you would structure data access in a real application

We're not expecting a production-ready system - focus on demonstrating your skills and decision-making.

**Submission**

- Provide a GitHub repository with your solution
- Include a README with:
  - Instructions for running the application
  - Any assumptions you made
  - Brief explanation of your architectural decisions
  - **Database design section**: How you would structure the database schema for this application (tables, relationships, indexes you'd consider)
  - What you would do differently with more time

We‚Äôll review your submission, and if successful you‚Äôll move on to the next-stage interview. Please note: we won‚Äôt have the opportunity to speak with you before reviewing your work, so make sure documents are clear and easy to follow on their own üòä

**Deadline:** You‚Äôll have one week to complete the task. Let us know if you need more time, we know people are busy!

**Have fun and show us how you work**
